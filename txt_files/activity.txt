Open eyes
Through the waves, cut through me
Hypnotised
By the sounds I'm breathing in
Hold tight, hold tight
Can't make coasts collide
Hold tight, hold tight, hold tight
Tripping lights
Paint the skies
All because of you
Tripping lights
Paint the skies
Only you, can make me move
You, you can make me move
Can make me move
You, you can make me move
Can make me-
Can make me move
Can make me
So alive, make it last forever
Stopping tight, your arms surrendering
Hold tight, hold tight
Can't make coasts collide
Hold tight, hold tight, hold tight
Tripping lights
Paint the skies
All because of you (of you, of you)
Tripping lights
Paint the skies
Only you can make me move
You, you can make me move
Can make me move (can make me move)
You, you can make me move
Can make me-
Can make me move
You, you can make me move
Can make me-
